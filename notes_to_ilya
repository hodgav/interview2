as you can see, i have two functions which i am having trouble deciding what to do at the case where *src is a NULL pointer

in getNiCount i return -1 if the pointer is NULL. do you think in this case i should return NULL too?


in replaceNiWithNI
i have a problem. 
the return type of this function is std::basic_string<charType>
i can not , on any case, return NULL or -1.
i did use templates there, as you can see.
also, read this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/930932/returning-different-data-type-depending-on-the-data-c
 
 "No. The return type of a C++ function can only vary based on
 explicit template parameters or the types of its arguments.
 It cannot vary based on the value of its arguments."
 
 so i recieve a pointer which is either of const char* or const wchar_t*
 only if its VALUE is null i want to return NULL. by what this guy is saying - it's impossible.

please suggest me what can be done

thanks.
