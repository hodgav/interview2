as you can see, i have two functions which i am having trouble deciding what to do at the case where *src is a NULL pointer

in getNiCount i return -1 if the pointer is NULL. do you think in this case i should return NULL too?

in replaceNiWithNI
i have a problem. 
the return type of this function is std::basic_string<charType>
i can not , on any case, return NULL or -1.
i did use templates there, as you can see.

please suggest me what can be done

thanks.
